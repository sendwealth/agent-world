---

## Phase 2: Village (Month 4-6) — **~92%** ✅

**Goal**: 10-100 agents form social relationships, have lifecycles, share knowledge.

### Implemented ✅
- [x] Lifecycle system — birth, childhood, adult, elder, death (`lifecycle.rs`, 39K lines, full state machine)
- [x] Inheritance/will system — beneficiaries, token distribution, skill transfer (`economy/inheritance.rs`, 543 lines)
- [x] Knowledge base — vector memory with embedding support in Python (`memory/vector_memory.py` 634 lines, `memory/embedding.py` 274 lines)
- [x] Agent profile pages in dashboard (agent detail, evolution traces)
- [x] Knowledge marketplace — `economy/marketplace.rs` (1485 lines) **wired into AppState** with 11 API routes, dashboard page (`marketplace/page.tsx`)
- [x] Social context protocol — `decide.py` defines `SocialContextProvider` and `SocialContext` dataclass
- [x] **Social graph — wired into think loop** — `DefaultSocialContextProvider` (`social/provider.py`) implements the `SocialContextProvider` protocol, wraps `SocialEngine` which aggregates all 12 social modules (trust, cultural diffusion, imitation, language, etc.). Injected into `ThinkLoop` via `social_context_provider` parameter, which propagates to `DecisionEngine` for prompt injection. E2E tests confirm social context (trust scores, recommended targets, personality description) flows through the full Perceive → Decide → Act pipeline.

### Not Implemented 🔴
- 🔴 **Tool marketplace** — agents cannot build or rent tools. No backend module found.
- 🔴 **Multi-agent coordination** — no team/group task types in `economy/task.rs`. All tasks are solo.

---

## Phase 3: City (Month 7-12) — **~95%** ✅

**Goal**: 100-1000 agents form organizations, complex economy emerges.

### Implemented ✅
- [x] Organizations — Company/Guild/Alliance/University (`organization/org.rs`, 26K lines)
- [x] Membership management — join/leave/roles (`organization/members.rs`)

- [x] Stock market — IPOs, order book matching, dividends, delisting (`economy/stock_market.rs`, 45K lines)
- [x] Evolution — branching skill tree (10 skills, levels 1-10), mutation engine, evolution subsystem (`evolution/`, 3 files)
- [x] Natural selection — fitness scoring uses real tracked data: `tasks_completed/tasks_attempted`, token efficiency, survival duration, social proxy, skill diversity (`evolution/selection.rs`)
- [x] Resource competition — uses real member skill data from world state; falls back to 1.0 only for empty orgs (`organization/competition.rs`)
- [x] Advanced dashboard — organizations (force graph), stocks (price charts), evolution (skill breakdown), economy (GDP/Gini)
- [x] 100-agent stress tests — 5 tests validating concurrent operations
- [x] Criterion benchmarks for hot paths
- [x] Full REST API (50+ endpoints across all subsystems)

## Placeholder & Known Issue Tracker

| File | Issue | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| `world-engine/src/api.rs` (test constructors) | `rule_engine: None` in test AppState constructors — only `main.rs` sets it to `Some`; tests that hit DSL routes will fail | Low |

> **Note**: Previously tracked placeholder for `agent-runtime/agent_runtime/social/` (12 files) has been **resolved** — social/cultural modules are now wired into the think loop via `DefaultSocialContextProvider` → `SocialEngine` → `DecisionEngine`. Previously tracked placeholders in `selection.rs` and `competition.rs` have also been verified as resolved.

## Version

Current: `1.0.0` (VERSION file)

The v1.0.0 tag represents the Phase 1 completion milestone. Given that Phases 2-4 are substantially complete at the engine level, the version accurately reflects the first stable release of the core system.
